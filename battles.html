    <h1> BATTLES </h1>
    
    <p> A battle in Dragoton takes LITERALLY 5 minutes. Here's how it works:
      
      <li> only 8 dragons per battle </li>
      <li> each one of your dragons have moves based on your elements!</li>
      <li> when your dragons get powerful enough, you can unlock golden moves: the most powerful of them of all</li>
      <li> if no one is defeated over these 5 minutes, SUDDEN DEATH will appear on your screen, and you'll have 1 minute to get rid of it.. and of course, if you don't, SUDDEN DEATH will happen... and there's nothing you can do to stop it.... MWAHAHAHAHAH!</li>
    <h3> There are 4 types of battles:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Alliance Battles</li>
      <li> Arena Battles</li>
      <li> Conquest Battles</li>
      <li> Dragon Cup</li>
        
      <h4> Heres what each battle means:</h4>
    </ol>
    <li> Alliance Battles: you battle with someone in your alliance - Your teammates - and if you beat them, you get an ALLIANCE CHEST! They can have lots of valuable things!!!</li>
    
    
    <li> Arena Battles: You battle with someone randomly selected from arround the world, and when you win, you can get prize boxes!</li>
    
    <li> Conquest Battles: your WHOLE alliance battles against another alliance... each person chooses 1 AND ONLY 1 one dragon per member... if your alliance wins, you get alliance points!!! (which determines how good an alliance is) </li>
    
    <li> Dragon Cup Battles: these battles can let you win a dragon once you complete the cup! Each cup will have from 5 - 13 stages, but sadly, there are only 20 cup battles avalable currently... </li>
