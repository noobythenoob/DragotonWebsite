  <h1> LEVELS OF ACHIEVEMENT!</h1>
  <body>
    
     
    <ol>
      <p>
      <li> Level 1: At Level 1, you get a starter dragon (as we already explained in Creatures and Elements). You start off with a Level 1 arena, breeding cave, a hatchery, and a free 30 day award system for every day you play.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
      <li> Level 2: At Level 2, you don't get a new dragon, but you get an upgrade for your dragon, a Level 2 arena, a Level 2 breeding cave, and 3 eggs for your new, improved, luxourious hatchery. This will include 3 spaces for eggs. The 30 day award system will turn down to a 5 day award system, so every week you will get a new reward.
You will also get a "Settling Down" achievement if you kill all the villagers and claim their houses.</li> </p>
      
   <p>   <li> Level 3: At Level 3, you get another upgrade for your dragon, a Level 3 arena, a Level 3 breeding cave, and you won't get a new hatchery. The award system will stay as 5 days a week. There will not be another acheivement until Level 5. </li>
      </p>
   <p>   <li>Level 5: At Level 5, you will get farms. A farm produces food for your dragons. You will get 2 chests, a quest battle, and you can even join an alliance! There will not be another acheivement until Level 8.</li></p>
      
   <p>   <li>Level 8: At Level 8, this is the time when the award system will drop down to 1 per week. Events will be unlocked, and you will unlock a gold upgrader (to upgrade the amount of gold your habitats produce) and a gem producer!</li> </p>
      
  <p>    <li>Level 10: At Level 10, you can create an alliance, which is important, because YOU make the restraints in the alliance. You will be able to now unlock ALL elemental basic dragons, and all space dragons. There will also be the adventure section! You will ONLY be able to do this if your game is updated to Dragoton...Version 2.1! It will also be known as the "New Normal of Dragotonia."</li> </p>
      
   <p>   <li> All other levels:  We both think you are ready to go off on your own! There will be no more starter levels. You will only be known as a Blank Supporter (but you'll still have your username.) </li>
