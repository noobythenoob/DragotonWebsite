    <h1>Terrains</h1>
    <p> There are different terrains that correspond to the different elements of the dragons in the land of Dragoton. In each terrain, there is a chance to get:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> dragons of that element</li>
      <li> chests of that element</li>
      <li> gems of that element</li>
      <li> diferrent metals (for shopping) these metals can be combined with your dragon, and with enough pieces of metal, you can eventually become a METAL DRAGON! These are rare and use the pieces wisely!</li>
      <li> weapons of that element</li>
      <li>different arenas for each element can also be played!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, there are a few exceptions to the terrains and arenas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Magic terrains can only be accessed by magic portal</li>
      <li> Space terrains can only be accessed with the space trident</li>
      <li> Alliances can NOT come with you to magic OR space terrains - however, they CAN fight with you/against you in alliances
