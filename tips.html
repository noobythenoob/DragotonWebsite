      <li>Random chests will drop. Use them wisely... you never know what can happen! </li>
      <li>Explore every nook and cranny in the terrain! There are gems that you can get, and you can use them in the shop.</li>
      <li> Put the sound down every time you see an ogre. This means there is going to be a boss fight... and they're LOUD.</li>
        <li>Breed your STRONGEST dragons for strong dragon eggs... We won't guarantee they are strong... they may be as strong as you in real life... sorry. - -â‚§  </li>
