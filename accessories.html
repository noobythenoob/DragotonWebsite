    <h1> ACCESSORIES </h1>
    
    <h2> This is the Accessories page.</h2> 
    <h3>If it is a certain time, like Christmas, a Christmas event will be going on, and in it, there will be some chances to get Christmas accessories: such as a Christmas tree hat! </h3>
    <p> Other accessories have different properties (such as a fire necklace which can boost the fire power on a dragon with the element fire by 20%) ... You can collect an elemental set (which is the recomended collection of accessories, such as all fire accessories, and the same thing with all the other elements listed on the Elements and Creatures page) if you work hard enough!!! Good Luck! </p>
